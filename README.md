# LanguageComparison
c++ and java
Language purpose/genesis
Why was the language created?
Java
Needed an architecture-neutral language for developing on multiple different embedded electronics or on the World-Wide Web.
C++
Needed the performance of C but the easier large-scale development that classes in Simula provided.
What problems was the language trying to address?
Java
Supporting multiple platforms requires compiling a different version for each platform. Sometimes supporting different platforms requires major rewrites.
C++
Developing large scale software is difficult in low-level languages and many class oriented solutions at the time were too slow.
Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Java
Reaction to Objective-C
Sought to replace C++
C++
Reaction to Simula, and BCPL
Sought to replace C
Unique features of the language
Does the language have any particularly unique features?
Java
One of a few languages that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
Compiles to Java bytecode.
C++

Name spaces
How are name spaces implemented?
C++
namespace <name_of_namespace> {  }
Java
Java packages
directly mapped to file
How are name spaces used?
C++
Name spaces are used to allow multiple classes to have the same name by being in different name spaces.
Java
Name spaces in java allow multiple classes to have the same name but also dictates the file location of the class.
Types
What types does the language support?
C++
Boolean
Character
Integer
Float
Double
Wide Character
Enumeration
Java
Byte
Short
Integer
Long
Float
Double
Boolean
Character
Enumeration
Are both reference and value types supported?
C++
Both Reference and value types are supported
Java
Both Reference and value types are supported
Can new value types be created?
C++
Yes through Classes
Java
Yes through Classes
Classes
Defining
C++
class Something {}
classes have no access modifiers
Java
class Something {}
access modifiers to class are optional
public class â€¦ 
Creating new instances
C++
Something something;
Something *something = new Something();
Java
Something something = new Something();
